- This Week Expected: ${kpis.thisWeekExpected} shipments for capacity planning
- Average Lead Time: ${kpis.averageLeadTime} days (shipping to arrival)
- Delayed Shipments: ${kpis.delayedShipments} shipments behind schedule

RECEIVING PERFORMANCE:
- Receiving Accuracy: ${kpis.receivingAccuracy}% (expected vs received quantities)
- On-Time Delivery Rate: ${kpis.onTimeDeliveryRate}% (supplier performance)
- Total Inbound Shipments: ${shipments.length}
- Active Suppliers: ${suppliers.length} delivery partners

OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS:
- Today's Receiving Workload: ${todayArrivals.length} shipments
- Quality Issues: ${shipments.filter(s => s.expected_quantity !== s.received_quantity).length} quantity discrepancies
- Geographic Sources: ${[...new Set(shipments.map(s => s.ship_from_country).filter(Boolean))].length} countries
